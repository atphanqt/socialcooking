  "readme": "# fileupload\n\nThis module's main aim is to make file uploads even easier in Node.JS, for any number of different storage adapters (file system, gridfs, s3 etc). The only storage adapter built into this module is for file system based uploading, this keeps the original code base as minimal as possible.\n\nfileupload is built in a way that totally decouples the storage adapter from the module itself, so you can create your own adapters as long as they implement get(), put() and delete(), then fileupload will create the middleware using the adapter passed in. For example if you wanted GridFS file uploads, you simply require that module as well as this one. E.g:\n\n     var fileupload = require('fileupload');\n\n     var middleware = fileUpload.createFileUpload({\n       adapter: require('fileupload-gridfs')({ database: 'mydb' })\n     }).middleware;\n\nWhen instantiated, this module returns 4 functions:\n\n- middleware - route middleware\n- get - to retrieve uploaded files\n- put - to add files to the upload directory\n- delete - to remove uploaded files\n\n## Installation\n\n     npm install fileupload\n\n## Basic Usage - File system uploading\n\n### middleware()\n\nRoute middleware for connect to process file uploads.\n\nFile uploads have been built in to Connect since 1.8, but they dont come in to the post body (req.body) like other form fields, they get put into req.files.\n\nThis piece of route middleware moves the files to the upload directory specified in the constructor and adds the files to req.body as if they were normal form fields.\n\n     var fileupload = require('fileupload').createFileUpload('/uploadDir').middleware;\n\n     app.post('/upload', fileupload, function(req, res) {\n       // files are now in the req.body object along with other form fields\n       // files also get moved to the uploadDir specified\n     });\n\n###get()\n\nRetrieves a file from the upload directory.\n\n\n     var fileupload = require('fileupload').createFileUpload('/uploadDir');\n\n     fileupload.get('path-to-uploaded-file.gif', function(error, data) {\n       // data is the contents of the file\n     });\n\n###put()\n\nPuts a file to the upload directory.\n\n\n     var fileupload = require('fileupload').createFileUpload('/uploadDir');\n\n     fileupload.put('path-to-file.gif', function(error, file) {\n       // file is an object with information about the uploaded file\n       // See below for the contents of this object\n     });\n\n###delete()\n\nDeletes a file from the upload directory.\n\n\n     var fileupload = require('fileupload').createFileUpload('/uploadDir');\n\n     fileupload.delete('path-to-file.gif', function(error) {\n\n     });\n\n###File object\nThe file objects that are returned from the middleware and put actions contain the following fields:\n\n- size - size of the file\n\n- type - mime type of the file\n\n- path - the folder name that the file has been stored in\n\n- basename - the name of the file\n\nHere is an example file object:\n\n     {\n       size: 3909,\n       type: 'image/gif',\n       path: 'b36e7d8a26e5dac9be9d9a5ad76cedb5/',\n       basename: 'test1.gif'\n     }\n\n\n# Creating your own adapters\nAs mentioned above, creating your own adapters is as simple as implementing a module that returns 3 functions: get(), put() and delete(). An example of another adapter is [fileupload-gridfs](https://github.com/domharrington/fileupload-gridfs/). If you create an adapter and would like it to be added to the list below, DM me and I will add it in, or send a pull request with an updated readme.\n\n##List Of Adapters\n- [GridFS](https://github.com/domharrington/fileupload-gridfs/)\n\n## Todo\n\n- <s>GridFS</s>\n- S3\n- SFTP\n- Better code documentation\n\n## Credits\n[Dom Harrington](https://github.com/domharrington/)\n\n## License\nLicensed under the [New BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)",
